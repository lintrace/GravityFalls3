# GravityFalls3
After acquiring the children of the book Gravity Falls: Journal 3,
it became necessary to read encoded messages.
Here are the functions on the python for decoding messages in the Russian version of the book.
To decrypt messages, run gravity_falls.py
Functions can be used for both decryption and encryption of messages.
Implemented:
1) Atbash Cipher
2) Caesar's Cipher
3) Vigen√®re's code (slightly modified algorithm, can simultaneously encode and Caesar's algorithm)
I hope someone this can be useful.
